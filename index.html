Enhanced physics, realistic NPC behavior, and a more immersive environment will likely elevate the player experience. Speculation suggests that the game will also innovate its online mode, potentially offering a more integrated and seamless experience between single-player and multiplayer elements.</p>
            
        <p>The visual fidelity of GTA 6 is another aspect generating excitement. Leveraging next-gen hardware capabilities, the game promises breathtaking graphics, with lifelike lighting, textures, and character animations. Rockstar is known for pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in game design, and fans expect nothing less than a visual and technical masterpiece.</p>
